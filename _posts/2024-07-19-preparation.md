## Preparation (the day before)
Preparing for the trip is already a very exciting (and tiring) part of the trip. 
It is hard work. If you can, plan in advance and do not leave it to the last day. 
But we always do!

1. **Rooftop tent** - find some  helpful neighbours you neer spoke to before, break the ice, bring them some single malz (or beer)
   and have go at it. In our case, we spoke to Julia and Moritz, who kindly helped us! Thank you!
2. **Helpful wife** - Have a helpful wife to pack the most important things for you. Do not forget to thank her! Thank you, my dear!:)
3. **Fishing gear** -  Do not forget your fishing gear. Kidding, how could I (you) forget it? I have been preparing it for a few months. On the last
   day I thought I don't have the right flies, so I had to have a quick tying session.  Do not do this, if you can :).
4. **Night before** - Try to get some sleep the night before. I usually cannot, being too excited about what is coming.
I thought about the trip, what I might have forgotten, worried about the weather and still not having the right kind of flies.
I woorried that I worry too much and cannot get enough sleep for the next day, when we had to make over 1K kilometers through
whole Germany and over to Denmark. We woke up a few minutes before the alarm clock, brigh morning light and dew on the grass at around 4.30am.
The morning when you embark on such a trip is the most exciting.
We feel exhilareated like seeing a new life born - the life of a new trip!
